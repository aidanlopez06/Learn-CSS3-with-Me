# Learn-CSS3-with-Me
This is a learning CSS3 for dummies. 
So I have made an easy way to understand what the most important things in CSS3 do. I am following HuXn WebDev's videos for this just as a way to pace the learning. If interested in getting a visual representation, and then want to recreate the code I have made, please feel free to use this. Else, use this as a refresher to individual CSS properties, units, etc. I will regularly update this, and feel free to download to see the styling added by the css code.
